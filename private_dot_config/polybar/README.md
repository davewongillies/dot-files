# polybar

This directory contains my configuration for [https://github.com/jaagr/polybar](polybar),
which is a status bar, which I use instead of i3status.

I build package for Ubuntu Xenial currently and publish them to my repo on bintray:

```
# echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/davewongillies/fpm-recipes xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/davewongillies-fpm-recipes.list
# apt-get update
# apt-get install polybar
```
